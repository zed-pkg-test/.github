# Copilot instructions for `zed-pkg-test`

## Durable engineering policy

- This repository defines public organization-wide defaults for `zed-pkg-test`.
- Never commit credentials, private keys, access tokens, customer data, or private-repository inventories.
- Resolve Git conflicts semantically: inspect both sides, the merge base, nearby tests and contracts, and normally 3–10 relevant prior commits. Never blindly select all of `ours` or all of `theirs`.
- Prefer focused pull requests, explicit validation, non-destructive Git operations, and documented tradeoffs.
- Cross-repository integration uses versioned interfaces, APIs, SDKs, events, or explicitly owned replicated read models. Services do not reach into another service's database by default.
- `*-infra` repositories and `*-monorepo` application source remain separate. A `*-infra` repository must never appear as a Git submodule under `*-monorepo/apps`.
- Git submodules are reserved for explicitly coordinated editable source composition. Zed packages or immutable artifacts are preferred for package dependencies. Production deploys immutable artifacts or OCI digests, not source clones.

Before proposing code, identify repository boundaries and existing interfaces. Preserve compatible intent during conflict resolution, avoid destructive recovery commands, and add or update tests with behavior changes.
